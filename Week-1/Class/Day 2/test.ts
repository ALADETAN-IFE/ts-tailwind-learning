// Here are three practice questions for each of the main topics you learned:

// 1. Basic Types:
// * Define a variable studentName as a string, isGraduated as a boolean, and grade as a number. Assign appropriate values to each.
// * Create an array prices that only accepts numbers. Try adding a string to it and see what TypeScript says.
// * Define a variable data that can accept either a string or a number. Assign a string to it and then a number. Verify that both assignments work.

// 2. Tuples, Enums, and Objects
// * Create a tuple personInfo that stores a person's ID (number), name (string), and age (optional, number). Assign values to it.
// * Define an enum Days representing the days of the week. Assign specific values to at least three days and log their values.
// * Create an object car with properties: brand (string), model (string), and year (number). Use a type alias to define its structure.

// 3. Functions
// * Write a function multiply that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their product.
// * Create a function greet that accepts a name (string) and an optional age (number). If the age is provided, it should include it in the greeting message.
// * Implement a function logMessage that logs a message to the console. It should accept either a string or a number as input and return nothing.

// 4. Interfaces
// * Define an interface Product with properties id (number), name (string), and price (number). Create an object item using this interface.
// * Create an interface Operation for a function that takes two numbers and returns a number. Implement the function to calculate the division of two numbers.
// * Create an interface Shape with a method area() that returns a number. Implement a class Rectangle that adheres to this interface.

// 5. Classes and Subclasses
// * Create a class Animal with properties name and species (both strings). Add a method describe that returns a description of the animal. Instantiate the class and call the method.
// * Extend the Animal class to create a Dog class. Add a property breed and a method bark that returns "Woof!".
// * Create a class Circle with a property radius. Add a method area to calculate and return the area of the circle.

// 6. Generics
// * Write a generic function reverseArray that takes an array of any type and returns it reversed.
// * Create a generic class Stack with methods push, pop, and peek. The stack should work with any data type.
// * Use a generic function filterArray to filter out items from an array. The function should accept an array and a callback function as arguments.
// Would you like me to elaborate on any of these questions or provide sample solutions? ðŸ˜Š
