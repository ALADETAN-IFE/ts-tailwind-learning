## **Overview**
This repository is my personal learning space for **TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS**, where I experiment with concepts, solve challenges, and build projects to solidify my understanding.

- **Duration:** 2 months
- **Focus Areas:**
  - TypeScript fundamentals: types, interfaces, generics, and React integration.
  - Tailwind CSS: utility-first CSS, responsive designs, animations, and custom configurations.

---

## **Technologies**
- **TypeScript**: Enhancing JavaScript with strong typing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling applications.
- **React.js**: Building component-based UIs with TypeScript and Tailwind.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
